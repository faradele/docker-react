# To prevent travis error like 'rakefile not found', we will add the next line 
language: generic

# We need super use permission
sudo: required

# The programs we need to be available before the travis runs
services:
  - docker

# These are the commands we want travis to execute before our tests run
before_install:
  # We can use any tag we want in travis build process since the image will only exist here on travis
  - docker build  -t faradele/docker-react -f Dockerfile.dev .

# Add the commands or scripts that will be executed as part of our test
# This is where we tell travis how to run our tests
script:
  # Run the built docker image with the default command overridden so we can pass in the 
  # npm run test command as the startup command so our tests run when the command starts 
  # we also need to make sure our test command runs once and exits so that travis can move along 
  # instead of waiting indefinitely for the response
  - docker run -e CI=true faradele/docker-react npm run test
